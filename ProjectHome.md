# Python wrapper for Google Maps API. #

Easily create/display google maps without having to touch javascript at all.
Very useful if using maps in a webapp using a python framework like django or turbogears.

It currently supports points, points with html and points with custom images.

In combination with geopy (http://exogen.case.edu/projects/geopy/) you can cover geocoding and displaying maps from python alone.

Currently the code is going through a complete rewrite to support other map types.
